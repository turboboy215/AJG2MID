Song pointers
=======================================
Pointers to songs are represented by a series of JP (C3) jump commands.

The pointers to channels 1-3 are represented by a series of LD DE (CD 3D) commands, followed by CALL (11) commands to an address initializing the respective channels. Sometimes, the channels are not initialized in order in the code; see the address being called to get the correct order. Channel 4 is not directly called; instead, it is "controlled" by one of the other channels (see later).
Each of the song's channels are comprised of "patterns" consisting of 16-bit pointers to each "position" of a song. For songs that loop at a different position than where they started with, the channel's patterns are terminated with "0000" followed by a pointer to the location of the pattern where the channel restarts. Other patterns only have one position.

The pattern format
=======================================
Each of the patterns for channels 1-3 are comprised of the following commands: (Notes are the same as MIDI values but an octave higher)
